	<h1> 1. Presidential Assets Register - Africa ~ Heads of State and Government. </h1> 

	<p> 
	Over the last three years, I have embarked on an independent research project to compile a register of the salaries, benefits and <br> known assets of the 54 sitting African heads of state (from 1978 to present). Since 2011, I have conducted this research from a comparative perspective, looking at the relationship between the individual (and state) control of economic assets and regime longevity and levels of democracy in Africa. 
</p> 
		
	<p> 
		My goal is to establish a searchable database that presents the “asset profiles” of all 54 presidents, juxtaposing this with <br> other indicators in the respective countries. </p> 
		

<p> 	I would like to use this data as a platform for a “follow-the-money” project that documents the salaries, benefits and known <br> assets key politicians in all African countries and is regularly updated, similar OpenSecrets.org but on a smaller scale.  </p> 

	<p> For the project I would like to learn how to build a searchable database using either Google Spreadsheets for easy updates <br> and collaboration or other tools. I would also need to learn to use data stored in .csv and .pdf and to use web scrapping methods to collect public data from government websites and servers. </p> 

	<h2> The data I have so far includes: </h2>

	  1. Capital flight data showing how much money some African countries have lost in capital flight since 1970. <br> 
	 2. Aid data showing how much African countries receive in aid from OECD countries annually. <br>
	  3. A list of presidents and their salaries I have compiled from news reports and research.  <br>
	  4. UN data on socio economic indicators in different countries.  <br>
	  5. Corruption indexes from Transparency International. <br>
	 6. Political freedom Index from Freedom House and Press Freedom rankings from Reporters San Frontiers.  <br>

	<p> I would like to pitch parts of this project to The Guardian, Foreign Policy Magazine, TIME Magazine and the Mail & Guardian. <p> 


<h1> 2. Per Capita Expenditure for California Fire Departments by County </h1> 



<p> I would like to examine how much the fire deparments in California counties spend on disaster preparedness in proportion to <br>
	population size</p>
	
	<p> This is news worthy because wild fires are one of the biggest threats to the agriculture industry, which is one of <b> 
		California's key sources of income. Looking at disparities in expenditure on disaster preparedness would help <b>
		us understand the role of local governments limiting the impact of wild fires on key industries that are <b>
		vulnerable. </p>
